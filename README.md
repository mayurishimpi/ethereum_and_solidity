Discovering how to program smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain platform using Solidity

# My research objective
The objective of this research is to develop a lending system on the Ethereum platform. This system integrates credit scoring used in the traditional banking system to assess borrower's risk of defaulting. Firstly, a notary validates the authentic identity of a borrower and then a group of auditors securely stores a portion of the borrower's real identity in an Ethereum account, all while ensuring the borrower's anonymity is maintained. And secondly, the smart contract for the credit bureau connects lenders and borrowers and updates the credit scores. Furthermore, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is employed to automatically calculate and update credit scores directly on the blockchain.
